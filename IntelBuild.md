## The Intel build is currently badly out of date ##

The Intel version is badly out of date. The previous maintainer is currently unable to issue new releases due to hardware failure. There is no guarantee there will be a future Intel release past 17.0.2, so the Intel build is officially _**deprecated**_.

## Power Macintosh users should _not_ use this version ##

If you are unable to determine what type of computer you have, please read the article on WhichVersion. **PowerPC users should use the regular TenFourFox available from our [main page](http://www.tenfourfox.com/).**

## Whaaat, an Intel Mac version?? ##

Although TenFourFox is intended for Power Macs, there are a number of Intel Macs that for a variety of reasons remain on 10.4 and 10.5. Although our recommendation is, as always, to upgrade them to 10.6 if at all possible and run the real Firefox (which all Intel Macs, even 32-bit ones, are capable of), this at least gives those users an alternative: a browser built using the 10.4 compatibility layer in 10.4Fx, but using Intel code for the JavaScript JIT and SSE acceleration for graphics.

## This version is _not supported_ ##

10.4Fx's primary focus of development remains Power Macs. As a consequence, the Intel version is maintained on a **best effort basis** and, unlike the PowerPC stable branch, **is not release quality**. That means builds and updates are not guaranteed to be timely, bugs may not be fixed on an expedited basis (even serious ones) or even at all, and no bug reports will be accepted for the Intel version on Tenderapp. Furthermore, it is unlikely the Intel version will ever become fully supported and you should not expect this lack of support to change.

**The Intel version may be withdrawn or decommissioned at any time, without warning.** You use it _at your own risk_.

Because **this version is not supported**, it is not offered on the main page and is only offered here.

## System requirements ##

Intel TenFourFox requires any Intel Mac and Mac OS X 10.4.11, 10.5.8 or 10.6.8, with at least 512MB of physical memory and 100MB of hard disk space. A Core 2 Duo or better is recommended. Although the browser will probably run on OS X 10.7+, because of its use of older unsupported APIs it is not supported on Lion or any subsequent version of Mac OS X.

## Known issues specific to the Intel release ##

You should also read the most current release notes (right now ReleaseNotes1702), as most issues specific to TenFourFox for Power Macs also apply to this version.

## Download and installation ##

Current release: http://tenfourfox.googlecode.com/files/TenFourFoxIntel-17.0.2.app.zip

Unzip the application (using the built-in ZIP, not a utility such as Zipeg) and copy it to your Applications folder. Double-click to start.

Again, do not report bugs or questions on the Intel release to Tenderapp.
